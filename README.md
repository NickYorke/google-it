# google-it
Creates on-the-fly linking with Google search results using either the text wrapped in the HTML anchor tag, or, a manually entered string.

## Usage
Add either of the following to the `<head>` of the HTML document.

#### Link to GitHub hosted JavaScript file
`<script src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NickYorke/google-it/master/google-it.js"></script>`

#### Copy the function directly into your HTML
 ```
<script type="text/javascript">
function GoogleIt(e)
	{
	var searchURL = "http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=";

	if (e.nodeType == 1)
		{
		var searchString = e.innerHTML;
		}
	else
		{
		var searchString = e;
		}

	var searchArray = searchString.split(" ");

	for (i = 0; i < searchArray.length; i++)
		{
		searchURL = searchURL + searchArray[i] + "+";
		}

	searchURL = searchURL.substring(0, (searchURL.length - 1));

	window.open(searchURL);
	}
</script>
```

Links can now be added to the `<body>` of the HTML document through one of two different ways.

#### Method 1

`<a href="#" onclick="GoogleIt(this)">Text used for the search</a>`

Text within the HTML anchor tag is automatically used as the string for the Google search results. This provides a quick route to get the results page in cases where the display text would be the same as the searched text.

#### Method 2

`<a href="#" onclick="GoogleIt('Text used for the search')">Text for display only</a>`

Text passed to the GoogleIt function is used as the string for the Google search results, while the text within the HTML anchor tag is for display purposes only. This allows some flexibility to have a search phrase that is more specific than the text being displayed.
